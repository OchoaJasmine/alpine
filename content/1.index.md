#title
Hi, my name is Jasmine Ochoa.  

#description
In This Blog, I will tell you a little bit about me, who I am, and life in general. I am passionate about health and wellness, I like to document the places I travel and even as simple as the places I go out to eat. I am a foodie at heart and always down for the next adventourous bite! 
::

I am a recent graduate from Northwest University. I double majored in Business Management and User Expereience Design. Some of my favorite hobbies include cooking, swimming, reading, tennis, pickleball, and I am recently getting into golf.

In the next 5 years, I plan to be in a stable career. I am still not sure whether I want to go into Real Estate or the tech industry. I am still trying to figure out what I like and is the best fit for me. Maybe I can try both out and see which I like best.
